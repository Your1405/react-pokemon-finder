# React Pokemon Search App

## Introduction
This is a small project that I made to learn to work with React and API's. This application uses the PokeAPI to fetch Pokemon data. 

## Installation 
To run this project, make sure you have NodeJS v.14 or above installed.
Simply clone the repository, then run `npm run start` in your terminal.
To access the application, go to https://localhost:3000 in your web browser.
